# Predictive Analytics in Maritime Industry
Overview:
This project addresses predictive analytics in the maritime industry, with a specific focus on the Kattegat strait in the Baltic region. The objective is to enhance decision-making processes and mitigate risks associated with shipping in this area.

Dataset:
Finding an appropriate dataset posed initial challenges, but through persistent efforts, a suitable dataset was located. The project utilizes the Automatic Identification System (AIS) dataset to achieve its objectives.

Methodology:
Leveraging the AIS dataset, the project successfully developed a Random Forest (RF) classifier, achieving an impressive 98% accuracy in predicting vessel types navigating the Kattegat strait. Emphasis is placed on identifying cargo ships and tankers, vessels with higher ecological risks.

Outcome:
The model's ability to recognize patterns contributes to improved decision-making in navigating large container vessels, aiming to avoid maritime risks and optimize the supply chain in the region.
